# FormsSpammer

One of my colleagues at university created registration for event using Google Forms. He made couple mistakes and it was possible to send multiple aplications, be borm in 99.99.9999 or just have name with thousand characters. After discovering such possibilities I couldn't stop myself from atempting to create as simmple as possible script to fulfill that task form me.

## Getting Started

As I did't planned to share that code at first it may not be easiest to get it running, but as always I'm trying to keep amount of modules needed as small as I can. For now, whole project will be Visual Studio project to help resolve any problems with dependencies and allow me to possibly create some GUI in future.

### Prerequisites

Whole project has been wrote in Python3 in mind. Only two non standard modules has been used, that is: urllib & BeautifulSoup. Please make sure that You have them installed on Your machine.

### Installing

Instalation of project should be covered by Visual Studio. Just dowload or fork repo, open sln file and all nugets and dependencies should be included (At least I hope so).
